## Hangman Deluxe
This hangman game is run through a terminal in Heroku. 
This game is made for someone who wants to pass some spare time

## How to play
The user will try to guess the secret word before their 6 lives/attempts run out. Each faulty guess will take one life and add to the hangman structure. The objective is to guess the word before your lives run out. Your guessed letters will be displayed in the terminal. 

## Features

- Randomly generated words from a dictionary API
- Hidden letters which will reveal as the game progresses 
- Display of the hangman structure correlated to the players lives
- Messages displayed such as "You have already tried this word please try again"
- You cannot guess numbers or the same letter twice

## Features ideas

- Adding a difficulty setting to increase or decrease lives
- Adding a hint function
- Adding a explanation when guessing the word right(this word means ...)
- Allow player versus player mode to challenge another person
